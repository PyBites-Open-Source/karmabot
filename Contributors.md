# Contributing Guidelines

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process. 
We are happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to improve/add new scripts to this project. Thank you for helping out and remember,
**no contribution is too small.**

# Submitting Contributions👩‍💻👨‍💻
Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.
## Step 1 : Find an issue
- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

## Step 2 : Fork the Project
- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.
- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.

## Step 3 : Branch
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

## Step 4 : Work on the issue assigned
- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you. 
- Add all the files/folders needed.

## Step 5 : Commit
- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reveiwer
- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

## Step 7 : Pull Request
- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
- Voila! Your Pull Request has been submitted and will be reviewed by the moderators and merged.🥳

## Rules for Hacktoberfest
- To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any time zone. Pull requests can be to any public repository on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

## The Following examples will be considered as low quality PRs
- Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images). 
- Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request). 
- Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
- Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.

## Tip from us😇
It always takes time to understand and learn. So, do not worry at all. We know **you have got this**!💪
