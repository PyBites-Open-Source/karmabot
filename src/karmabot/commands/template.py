"""
0. Save/copy this file to a new file under commands/

1. Add logic to my_command and rename it to something more meaningful.
   Optionally you can access user, channel, text from the passed in **kwargs (don't remove this).

2. Add a useful docstring to your renamed my_command.

3. Return a message string that the command/bot should post to the channel.
   You probably want to add some code under __main__ to make sure the function does what you want ...

4. In bot/slack.py import the script, e.g.: from commands.template import my_command

5. Add the command to the appropriate dict: ADMIN_BOT_COMMANDS, PUBLIC_BOT_COMMANDS or PRIVATE_BOT_COMMANDS
   (public = for us in channels, private = for use in @karmabot DM)

6. PR your work. Thanks
